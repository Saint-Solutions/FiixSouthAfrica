title: "Farm maintenance CMMS software"
description: "As a farmer, your maintenance goals are straightforward: Save money on overhead and avoid equipment
breakdown during your busy seasons. We created our farm maintenance software to help you do those two things. The
software lets you pre-plan your spare part purchases (and save money), and it also schedules all your maintenance tasks
– so work gets done, and equipment lasts longer. You can also access your farm maintenance software from any internet
connected device. So you can even use your smartphone to control your farm maintenance tasks while you’re out in the
field working. Fiix CMMS was designed with farm maintenance in mind."
