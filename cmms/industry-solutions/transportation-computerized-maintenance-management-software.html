description: "There arenâ€™t many industries where maintenance is more important than transportation, especially public
transportation. From plane, train, light rail and bus maintenance, to ferries and subways, proper maintenance and
customer safety is of paramount importance and is subject to extreme scrutiny, accuracy and record keeping. If you
operate in one of these public transport environments, transportation maintenance software is a must. Software for
transportation can help you get your maintenance organized quickly."
