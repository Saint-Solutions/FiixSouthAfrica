tools. A computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) offers city maintenance managers a simple solution to this
problem. A CMMS makes it easier to manage road maintenance, public building maintenance, storage facility maintenance,
park maintenance and more. Our maintenance software increases the life of assets, tracks spending, improves
productivity, reduces unplanned downtime and minimizes inventory costs."
