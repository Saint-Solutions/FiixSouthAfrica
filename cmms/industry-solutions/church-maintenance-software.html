title: "Church maintenance CMMS software"
description: "This is church maintenance software that any church staff can use to comply with safety standards, keep
costs low, and prolong the life of older facilities. If youâ€™re still using a paper system or excel to manage your
facility, switching to a CMMS saves you time, hassle, and money. At only $40/month, per user, our CMMS is a budget
friendly choice for non-profit facilities. Whether you are responsible for a church, synagogue, mosque or temple, let us
help you maintain a safe, clean, welcoming environment.."
